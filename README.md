## Project Portfolio Description
This project is a collection of mini-projects that I am working on to showcase my skills and learn new things. The projects are in various stages of development, but I am constantly adding new ones and updating the existing ones. I am using this project as a way to learn new technologies and to practice my coding skills. I am also hoping to use it as a way to connect with other developers and to get feedback on my work. 

## Tasks Achieved
* The code was built from scratch using inspiration from different sources, the official documentation and the advance CSS bootcamp classes.
* The code has a basic HTML and CSS structure.
